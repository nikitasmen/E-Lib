# E-Lib

Digital library management web application for Hellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)

## Overview

E-Lib is a PHP-based web application designed for managing and accessing a digital library collection. The application provides a comprehensive platform for storing, organizing, and reading PDF documents with features like user authentication, book searching, online reading, and administrative tools.

The application features a modular architecture with separate routes for web pages and API endpoints, allowing for a clean separation of concerns and easy extensibility.

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **PHP 8.0 or higher** with the following extensions:
  - OpenSSL
  - MongoDB
  - JSON
  - Fileinfo
  - Ctype
  - PDO (if using SQL database in the future)
- **Composer** (PHP package manager)
- **MongoDB Server** (version 4.4 or later)
- **Web Server** (Apache/Nginx with mod_rewrite enabled)
- **Node.js** (for frontend assets compilation)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-lib.git
cd e-lib
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Generate application key:
   ```bash
   php -r "file_put_contents('.env', str_replace('your_jwt_secret_key_here', bin2hex(random_bytes(32)), file_get_contents('.env')));"
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DB_CONNECTION=mongo
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=27017
   DB_DATABASE=e_lib
   
   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
   
   # Application URL
   APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
   
   # Email Configuration (for notifications and support)
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
   MAIL_PORT=2525
   MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=hello@example.com
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
   ```

### Step 4: Database Setup

1. Ensure MongoDB is running
2. Import sample data (if available):
   ```bash
   mongorestore --db e_lib database/dumps/e_lib
   ```
   Or create the database manually.


### Step 5: Run the Application

#### For Development:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

#### For Production:
1. Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to point to the `public` directory
2. Set up proper SSL certificates
3. Configure your web server's document root to `/path/to/e-lib/public`

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your browser and visit:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8000`
- Admin Panel: `http://localhost:8000/admin` (if applicable)

Default admin credentials (if applicable):
- Email: admin@example.com
