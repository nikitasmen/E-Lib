# E-Lib

Digital library management web application for Hellenic Mediterranean University (HMU)

## Overview

E-Lib is a PHP-based web application designed for managing and accessing a digital library collection. The application provides a comprehensive platform for storing, organizing, and reading PDF documents with features like user authentication, book searching, online reading, and administrative tools.

The application features a modular architecture with separate routes for web pages and API endpoints, allowing for a clean separation of concerns and easy extensibility.

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **PHP 8.0 or higher** with the following extensions:
  - OpenSSL
  - MongoDB
  - JSON
  - Fileinfo
  - Ctype
  - PDO (if using SQL database in the future)
- **Composer** (PHP package manager)
- **MongoDB Server** (version 4.4 or later)
- **Web Server** (Apache/Nginx with mod_rewrite enabled)
- **Node.js** (for frontend assets compilation)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-lib.git
cd e-lib
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Generate application key:
   ```bash
   php -r "file_put_contents('.env', str_replace('your_jwt_secret_key_here', bin2hex(random_bytes(32)), file_get_contents('.env')));"
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DB_CONNECTION=mongo
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=27017
   DB_DATABASE=e_lib
   
   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
   
   # Application URL
   APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
   
   # Email Configuration (for notifications and support)
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
   MAIL_PORT=2525
   MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=hello@example.com
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
   ```

### Step 4: Database Setup

1. Ensure MongoDB is running
2. Import sample data (if available):
   ```bash
   mongorestore --db e_lib database/dumps/e_lib
   ```
   Or create the database manually.


### Step 5: Run the Application

#### For Development:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

#### For Production:
1. Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to point to the `public` directory
2. Set up proper SSL certificates
3. Configure your web server's document root to `/path/to/e-lib/public`

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your browser and visit:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8000`
- Admin Panel: `http://localhost:8000/admin` (if applicable)

Default admin credentials (if applicable):
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: password

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB Connection Issues**:
  - Ensure MongoDB service is running
  - Check connection string in `.env`
  - Verify database credentials and permissions

- **File Permissions**:
  - Ensure storage and bootstrap/cache directories are writable
  - Run `composer dump-autoload` if class not found errors occur

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Clear configuration cache: `php artisan config:clear`
  - Ensure `.env` file exists and is properly formatted

## 🔄 Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
git pull origin main
composer install
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run build
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available within the application at `/docs`. This includes:

- Technical implementation details
- API endpoints
- Database structure
- Authentication flows
- File management

## Document Processing

E-Lib currently handles PDF documents only:

### Supported File Types
- **PDF**: Full support with thumbnail generation and online reading

Uploads with any other extension are rejected at validation time (`FileHelper::$supportedTypes = ['pdf']`). Word, PowerPoint, EPUB, MOBI/AZW, and DJVU are not currently supported — there is no conversion or cover-extraction path for them in the codebase.

### Document Processing Features
- **Automatic Thumbnail Generation**: Creates thumbnails for PDF files using ImageMagick (`Imagick`) or `pdftoppm` (Poppler) as a fallback
- **Format Detection**: Extension-based detection, restricted to `.pdf`
- **Secure Storage**: Documents are stored with randomized filenames
- **Permission Control**: Admin-configurable download permissions

### Implementation Details
The document processing is handled primarily by the `FileHelper` class which:
- Detects file type based on extension (PDF only)
- Extracts thumbnails via ImageMagick or `pdftoppm`
- Handles file uploads with extension-allowlist validation
- Manages file storage with optimized paths for both Docker and local environments

## Document Viewers

E-Lib includes specialized viewers for different document formats to provide a seamless reading experience directly in the browser:

### PDF Viewer
- Built with PDF.js for client-side rendering
- Features:
  - Lazy loading of pages for performance optimization
  - Page navigation controls
  - Zoom functionality
  - Responsive design that works on mobile devices
  - JWT authentication for secure document access
  - High-quality rendering with adjustable scale

### Implementation
The document viewing system is implemented through:

- **DocumentViewer.php**: A central component that:
  - Loads the PDF viewer component
  - Handles authentication and permissions
  - Manages the UI framework for the viewer

- **Format-specific viewers**:
  - PdfViewer.php: Handles PDF documents
  - Additional viewers could be added for other formats in the future, but none exist today

### Document Security
- JWT token-based authentication for document access
- Server-side permission checks before serving documents
- Configurable download permissions that can be set per document
- Protection against direct URL access to document files

## Support System

E-Lib includes a comprehensive support system to assist users:

### Help Center Modal

The application features an interactive Help Center accessible from any page:

- **FAQ Section**: Common questions and answers for quick user reference
- **Documentation Links**: Direct access to detailed documentation pages
- **Rich Support Request Form**: Advanced form with the following features:
  - Rich text editing capabilities
  - Image embedding directly in support requests
  - Support for pasting images (clipboard integration)
  - File attachment functionality for screenshots or documents
  - Client-side validation for immediate user feedback
  - AJAX submission for a seamless user experience

### Implementation Details

The Support System is implemented through:

- **SupportModal.php**: A reusable component that can be included on any page
- **REST API Endpoint**: Handles support request submissions with attachments
- **EmailService Integration**: Routes support requests to the support team's email inbox
- **Image Processing**: Support for multiple image formats and automatic resizing

### User Support Flow

1. User accesses the Help Center through the support icon
2. User checks FAQ for immediate answers
3. If needed, user submits a detailed support request with optional images
4. Request is validated and sent to support staff
5. Confirmation is displayed to the user

## Email Configuration

The application uses PHPMailer to handle all email functionality. To configure email:

1. Set up your SMTP server information in the `.env` file:
   ```
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=support@epictetuslibrary.com
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="Epictetus Library"
   SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@epictetuslibrary.org
   ```

2. Email functionality is available through the `EmailService` class which provides:
   - Support request emails
   - General email sending capability
   - HTML-formatted emails
